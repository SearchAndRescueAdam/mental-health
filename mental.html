            about mental illnesses. By recognizing and identifying ways to offer support to people in need, we can lower
            the stigma regarding mental health and encourage all to seek professional help.</h2>

            <img src="photos/girlbeach.jpg">
            <p>Mental Health Issues, refer to a wide range of mental health conditions. These disorders can affect a person's mood, thought, and behavior. Common mental illnesses include anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and addictive behaviors. It is normal for people to face challenges with their mental health from time to time. However, when mental illness continues and no treatment is sought, an individual's ability to function in the community will decline.
